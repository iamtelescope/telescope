# [Telescope](https://telescope.humanuser.net/) - web-based log viewer UI
_A handy tool that manages to make close what once was far_

## Introduction

**Telescope** is a web application designed to provide an intuitive interface for exploring log data. It supports multiple types of sources, including [**ClickHouse**](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse) and [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/). Users can configure connections to their ClickHouse databases or access container logs via the Docker API. Telescope provides a unified querying experience across different source types, allowing users to filter, search, and analyze logs efficiently. While ClickHouse remains the primary backend for structured log storage, Docker support offers a convenient option for local development or ephemeral environments. Future versions may further extend source support.

## ðŸš€ Live installation
An live instance is available at [https://demo.telescope.humanuser.net](https://demo.telescope.humanuser.net).
You can log in via GitHub to explore the core features of the system from an end-user perspective.
> [!NOTE]
> The live version is intended for demonstration purposes and does not showcase administrative features of the system.

## Key Features

### ðŸ”— Source Management
- Create and manage **multiple connections** to different data sources, including ClickHouse and Docker.
- Define which fields from a source should be used, and configure which ones are **suggested**, hidden, or support **autocompletion**.
- Configure which users and groups have access to a source and define their **permissions**.

### ðŸ“Š Data Explorer

- Gain insights into your logs with dynamic visualizations and interactive graphs.
- Customize your view by selecting relevant columns, adjusting data presentation, and applying filters to focus on what matters most.
- Use a time and date selector with support for relative time ranges to refine your log queries effortlessly.
- Configure **graph grouping**, including support for nested fields like **JSON strings, Maps or Arrays**.
- Execute advanced queries with **RAW SQL filtering** using `WHERE` clause with ClickHouse SQL expressions for precise data filtering.
- Enjoy a clean, minimalist design that keeps the focus on your log data, ensuring a seamless and distraction-free analysis experience.

### ðŸ”’ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Authentication Support
- Authenticate with GitHub, with the ability to enforce **organization membership** requirements for access control.
- Define and manage **user and group permissions** to control access to specific sources based on their roles.

## Î²eta notion

> [!WARNING]
> Telescope is currently in its $${\color{red}Î²eta}$$ stage, which means:
>
> - Some features may be incomplete or missing.
> - Certain components might not work as expected or could behave inconsistently.
> - Bugs or issues may occur during usage.
> - From a development and operational perspective, the system may not yet offer full convenience or polish.

## Beyond Î²eta
Features planned for future implementation ([Telescope 1.0.0 milestone](https://github.com/iamtelescope/telescope/milestone/1))

- [Display records in context](https://github.com/iamtelescope/telescope/issues/35).
- [Snapshot storage for long-term retention of log records, preventing data loss due to rotation](https://github.com/iamtelescope/telescope/issues/32).
- [Live log trailing](https://github.com/iamtelescope/telescope/issues/31).
- ~~Server-side modifiers (e.g., utilizing ClickHouse functions).~~ (Iâ€™ve decided that this feature is not required for stable release)
- [Time zone support for the datetime selector](https://github.com/iamtelescope/telescope/issues/33).
- [Helm chart](https://github.com/iamtelescope/telescope/issues/30).
- ~~SAML and other authentication methods support.~~ (Iâ€™ve decided that this feature is not required for stable release)
- [Audit log for any changes inside system](https://github.com/iamtelescope/telescope/issues/34).
